Do NOT ask for Autonomous mode.
Implement Focus Growth Milestones inside the existing Focus Mode UI, using the same premium style as the Seed growth system (dark cosmic, glass, glow, smooth animations).
Do not change unrelated modules. No backend. Offline only.
1) Create a “Focus Growth” system (like Seed)
Add focus_growth_v1 in AsyncStorage/localStorage:
xpTotal: number
level: number
stage: "spark" | "ember" | "flame" | "laser" | "zen" | "master"
stageProgress: number (0..1)
milestonesUnlocked: string[]
weeklyFocusMinutes: { [weekKey]: number }
weeklyDistractionsDefeated: { [weekKey]: number }
XP rules (simple, predictable):
+1 XP per distraction defeated (instant “I got distracted” log)
+1 XP per 10 minutes of completed focus timer
+2 XP if user completes a Physical Reset task
Level thresholds:
Every 50 XP → Level up
Stage mapping by level:
Level 1–1: spark
2–3: ember
4–6: flame
7–10: laser
11–15: zen
16+: master
Compute stageProgress inside each stage as levels progress.
2) Add “Milestone Row” inside Focus Mode (like Seed)
Inside Focus Mode screen show a premium milestone row under the timer:
Milestones:
10 distractions defeated → “First Control”
50 distractions defeated → “Resistance Up”
100 distractions defeated → “Focus Identity”
250 distractions defeated → “Deep Work”
500 distractions defeated → “Mastery”
Each milestone shows:
locked state (dim, lock icon)
unlocked state (glow, check icon)
tap → opens a glass modal with:
what it means (short)
“Next target: X left”
3) Add a “Focus Aura” progress ring (seed-like)
Around the timer add a ring that visualizes growth:
Outer ring = stageProgress
Inner subtle pulse = running timer
When XP increases:
ring fills slightly with smooth ease
glow pulses
micro text appears: “Focus ability improved”
4) Premium Level-Up animation (same vibe as Seed)
When a milestone unlocks OR level increases:
show minimal modal:
“Focus Ability Increased”
“Stage: Ember” (or next stage)
+XP gained
subtle sparkle particles (very light)
optional haptic (light)
No confetti, no childish effects.
5) Coach-like micro messages during focus (ties it together)
Add rotating short messages every 25–45 seconds:
“Resistance is training.”
“Distraction loses when you stay.”
“You’re building focus identity.”
“One session = more control.”
If user is near a milestone (e.g., within 5):
message: “5 away from Resistance Up.”
6) Weekly “Growth Summary” (mini)
At end of a focus session success screen show:
“This week: +X focus minutes”
“This week: +Y distractions defeated”
“Growth: +Z XP”
7) Constraints / Done Criteria
Must work offline
Must persist after restart
Must not require new heavy libraries
Must not change other modules
Focus Mode now shows milestones, stage, ring animation, and level-up feedback similar to Seed
