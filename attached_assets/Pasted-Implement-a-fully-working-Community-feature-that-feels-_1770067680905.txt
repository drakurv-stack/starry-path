Implement a fully working Community feature that feels real and active, but runs on localStorage only (no backend required).
Everyone is anonymous (aliases only). Users can post, like, reply, and see a feed that stays after refresh.
Do NOT ask for Autonomous mode—implement directly.
1) Screens / Routing
Create:
/community → feed screen
Optional: /community/post/:id → post detail (or open thread in a modal)
Add a Home card/button that navigates to /community.
2) Data (localStorage)
Use key: community_v1
Store:
posts[]:
{ id, authorAlias, avatarSeed, createdAt, content, tags[], likeCount, likedByMe, replyCount, replies[] }
replies[] inside post:
{ id, authorAlias, avatarSeed, createdAt, content }
stats: numbers for “going strong vs folded” (saved once and reused)
userAlias: the current user alias (generated once)
lastSeenAt: timestamp (for “new posts” badge)
activitySeed: used to simulate new posts
3) Anonymous identity
Generate alias like: NightWalker_28, BlueComet_14, QuietLion_07
Generate a simple avatar placeholder (initials or gradient circle) using avatarSeed
No real names, no profiles, no DMs.
4) Seed realistic content (VERY IMPORTANT)
On first open, preload 40–60 posts with:
Mixed lengths (1–4 lines)
Tags like: #day1 #urge #win #relapse #focus #sleep #stress #motivation
Tone: supportive, honest, non-explicit
Mix English + Hinglish (optional). Keep it safe.
Also preload some replies (0–6 per post) and likes (random counts).
5) Feed UI (match your premium UI)
Dark starry background
Glass cards for posts
Top header: “Community” + subtitle “Anonymous support. No judgment.”
A stats card: “Going strong” vs “Folded” (stored once)
Tabs/sort:
Latest
Top (by likeCount)
Filter chips (optional): Urges, Wins, Relapse, Focus, Sleep
Each post card shows:
alias + “time ago”
content text
tags chips
Like button (heart) + count
Reply button + replyCount
“View thread” to open replies
6) Posting
Add “Create post”:
text area
tags selector (optional)
post appears instantly at top of feed
authorAlias = current userAlias
enforce safe content:
block explicit sexual words
show message: “Please keep posts non-explicit and supportive.”
7) Likes (must feel real)
Tap Like toggles likedByMe
Updates likeCount immediately
Persist to localStorage
Add micro animation: heart pop / subtle glow
Also add “fake like drift”:
When user opens Community, randomly increase likeCount on a few posts by +1 to +3 (only once per session) to make it feel alive.
Persist the changes.
8) Replies (threaded)
In thread view:
Show existing replies
Input to add reply
Reply appears instantly
Persist
Add “fake replies”:
After user posts or replies, schedule 1–2 simulated anonymous replies after a short delay (0.8–2.5s) like:
“You’ve got this. Try the 10-minute delay.”
“Day 3 was hardest for me too.”
Must be clearly supportive and non-explicit.
Persist them.
9) “New posts” realism
Simulate new posts:
On first open each day (or every X hours), add 1–3 new seeded posts with fresh timestamps.
Show small badge: “3 new posts since last time”
Update lastSeenAt when leaving the page.
10) Safety / compliance
No explicit descriptions
No porn links
No images
Add footer: “Informational peer support. Not medical advice.”
11) Done criteria
Feed loads with seeded posts
Like/unlike works and persists
Reply works and persists
Create post works
Sorting Latest/Top works
Fake activity (new likes/posts/replies) works and feels real
