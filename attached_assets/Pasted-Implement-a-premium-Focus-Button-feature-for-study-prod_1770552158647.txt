Implement a premium “Focus Button” feature for study/productivity that mirrors the Panic Button quality and UI.
Mobile-first, dark starry premium UI, glass cards, gradient buttons, smooth animations.
Use AsyncStorage/localStorage only (same storage style as the rest of the app).
Do NOT ask for Autonomous mode.
1) Access + Placement
Add a new Home CTA card: “Focus Button” (Study Rescue)
Route: /focus
2) Focus Flow (4 stages)
Use stepper dots + smooth slide transitions.
Stage A: Quick Capture (5–10 seconds)
Title: “Caught the distraction. Good.”
Ask:
“What distracted you?” chips (multi-select): Social media, YouTube, Chatting, Random browsing, Gaming, Overthinking, Laziness, Notifications
“How strong is it?” slider 0–10 (distraction pull)
Primary: “Start Focus Rescue”
Secondary: “Skip → start timer”
Stage B: 30–60 sec Reset
Quick breathing/grounding animation (shorter than Panic)
Text: “We’re switching mode: distraction → action”
Button: “Continue”
Stage C: Focus Sprint (Pomodoro-style)
Offer sprint presets: 10 / 25 / 45 minutes
Timer with Start/Pause/Reset
“Pick your task”:
Study (default)
Coding
Revision
Reading
Deep work
“Anti-distraction micro actions” checklist (choose 2):
Put phone face down
Close all tabs
Open notes/book now
2-minute desk reset
Write next 3 steps
Require: finish timer OR complete 2 actions → success
Stage D: Win Screen
“Focus session completed ✅”
Show:
minutes focused
estimated time saved (based on preset)
distractions resisted +1
Reward:
+1 orb for 10 min
+2 orbs for 25 min
+3 orbs for 45 min
Buttons:
“Start another sprint”
“Back to Home”
“Log check-in” (optional)
3) Tracking & Stats (like urges)
Create focus_v1 storage:
focusEvents[]:
{id, dateISO, startedAtISO, durationMin, taskType, distractionTypes[], pullLevel, actionsDone[], completed:boolean}
focusStats:
{distractionsResisted, totalFocusMinutes, bestDayMinutes, lastFocusAtISO}
On Home show mini stats card:
“Focus minutes: X”
“Distractions resisted: Y”
“Best day: Z min”
4) Integration
If Learn exists: recommend a lesson after session (“Focus Reset”)
If Seed exists: optionally add a small “growth boost” visual when a focus sprint is completed (do not change stage thresholds, only a micro glow/animation).
Make it work offline.
5) UI polish
Make Focus button distinct color accent (still within purple/blue theme)
Smooth animations for timer and completion
No clutter, premium spacing
6) Done criteria
Focus flow works end-to-end
Timer works reliably
Stats persist after restart
Distractions are counted like urges
UI matches premium app style
