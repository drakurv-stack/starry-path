Polish the entire app UI end-to-end to feel premium, consistent, and smooth like the reference screens.
Apply one unified design system across all screens: Welcome, Onboarding/Quiz, Results, Home Tabs, Panic Button, Coach, Learn, Community, Profile, Garden/Timeline, Insights, Calendar.
Do NOT add new features; focus only on UI/UX polish, consistency, animations, spacing, and typography.
Do NOT ask for Autonomous mode—implement directly.
1) Global Theme (Design System)
Create/centralize a theme with:
Background: dark space gradient (black → deep navy → purple)
Starfield overlay (subtle, performance-safe)
Typography scale:
H1 large bold (white)
H2 medium bold
Body text soft gray
Caption smaller muted
Primary accent: purple/blue gradient
Success accent: green glow
Warning accent: amber glow
Danger accent: red glow
Corner radius: 18–24 everywhere
Spacing system: consistent padding/margins (e.g., 16/20/24)
2) Reusable Premium Components (must be used everywhere)
Create and refactor screens to use these consistently:
ScreenContainer (handles gradient background + safe area + scroll)
GlassCard (blur, border, glow, consistent padding)
GradientButton (primary) + GhostButton (secondary)
ProgressBar (glassy track + gradient fill)
Chip (tags/triggers)
StatPill (small stats)
Header (title + subtitle + optional right icon)
BottomSheet / Modal style (same everywhere)
3) Navigation Polish
Smooth transitions between screens (fade/slide)
Consistent headers/back buttons
Tab bar styling (glass, icons, subtle glow)
Remove any abrupt jumps or inconsistent spacing
4) Screen-by-screen polish requirements
Welcome / Onboarding
Carousel indicators styled as glowing dots
Options/buttons large, pill-shaped, readable
Progress bar at top for quiz with “Back” + “Skip” aligned perfectly
Ensure text never clips on smaller phones
Home
Top hero streak card (glass + glow)
Primary CTA (Panic Button) visually dominant
Cards in a clean grid/stack, consistent height and spacing
Panic Button
Make it the most premium screen:
breathing circle animation smooth
step transitions elegant
timer + action checklist looks like a “luxury tool”
success screen has subtle celebration glow (not childish)
Coach
Chat bubbles glass style with consistent spacing
Typing indicator (3 dots) subtle
Quick action chips polished and aligned
Learn
Lesson cards uniform
Lesson detail typography readable
Quiz UI clean with selected state and explanations in glass cards
Show progress clearly at top
Community
Feed cards consistent
Like/reply buttons match style (icons + counts aligned)
Thread view clean and readable
Tags as chips, no clutter
Profile / Progress / Garden
Seed card premium
Timeline cards fade-in smoothly
Calendar tiles consistent with glow states
Stats arranged in neat rows (no randomness)
5) Micro-interactions (premium feel)
Add subtle animations globally:
Button press (scale down slightly)
Card appearance (fade + slight rise)
Progress bars animate on change
Achievement/milestone unlock: soft glow pulse
Haptics hooks optional but don’t add if not already supported
6) Accessibility + Readability
Ensure contrast is strong for dark UI
Increase tap targets (min 44px)
Avoid tiny text
Support long names and dynamic text lengths
7) Performance rules
Starfield must be light (no heavy particle engine)
Avoid excessive re-renders
Keep animations smooth (no stutter)
8) Final QA pass
After polish, ensure:
No misaligned buttons
No inconsistent fonts/sizes
No mixed corner radii
All screens look like the same product
App feels “premium calm” not “gaming neon”
9) Deliverable
Refactor UI so every screen uses the shared components + theme, with consistent spacing, animation, and color across the whole app.
