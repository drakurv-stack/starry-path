Implement a Seed Garden + Growth Timeline experience for this mobile app that feels premium and emotional.
Must match the reference UI: dark starry gradients, glass cards, glow accents, smooth animations.
Use AsyncStorage only for persistence. No backend. No explicit content.
Do NOT ask for Autonomous mode—implement directly.
1) New Screens / Navigation
Create:
A) /garden (Seed Garden)
A premium “growth” screen showing:
Current seed stage (Seed / Sprout / Plant / Tree)
Animated seed visual
Stage progress bar
Milestones timeline (7/30/60/90)
“Garden Atmosphere” background (stars + subtle particles)
B) /timeline (Growth Timeline)
A scrollable timeline showing:
Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, Day 30, Day 60, Day 90
Each milestone has:
icon / illustration placeholder
title
short description
locked/unlocked state
Add navigation entry points:
Home → “Seed” card → /garden
Profile → “Seed Garden” → /garden
Inside /garden add button “View Timeline” → /timeline
2) Data & Persistence (AsyncStorage)
Use or extend progress_v1:
Required fields:
streak.current
streak.longest
streak.freeSinceISO
seed.stage
seed.stageProgress (0..1)
seed.totalCleanDays
If missing, derive:
totalCleanDays = max(totalCleanDays, streak.longest or calendar clean count)
Persist:
last viewed garden time seed.lastViewedAtISO
3) Visual Design Requirements (Must Look Premium)
Background
Full-screen dark gradient: black → deep navy → purple
Starfield effect:
subtle dots
slow parallax as user scrolls (light, not heavy)
Glass Cards
Soft blur, rounded corners (16–24)
Thin border with low-opacity glow
Shadow / glow around important cards
Typography
Big title text: “Your Garden”
Soft subtitle text: “Growth happens one day at a time.”
Buttons
Gradient pill buttons (purple/blue)
Secondary button: translucent outline
4) Seed Visual (Animated)
Create a single seed component that changes by stage:
Seed stages:
Seed: small glowing seed orb
Sprout: seed + tiny leaf
Plant: bigger plant with 2–3 leaves
Tree: tall silhouette tree, subtle sparkle
Use simple vector-style shapes (no images required) using:
gradient circles + simple leaf shapes
or placeholder illustrations if already in assets
Animations (premium):
Idle animation: gentle breathing scale (1.0 → 1.03 → 1.0) with glow pulse
Progress animation: when stageProgress increases, animate bar fill smoothly + seed glow intensifies briefly
Stage upgrade animation:
seed scales up + soft “burst” sparkle particles
text toast: “Leveled up → Sprout 🌱”
subtle vibration/haptic (if supported)
5) Progress Bar (Stage Progress)
On Garden screen show:
Label: “Stage progress”
A premium progress bar:
glass track
gradient fill
small sparkle traveling along fill (optional)
Text: “X days to next stage”
Stage thresholds:
Seed: 0–6
Sprout: 7–29
Plant: 30–89
Tree: 90+
Compute:
daysIntoStage and daysRemaining
stageProgress = daysIntoStage / stageLength
6) Milestone Row (7 / 30 / 60 / 90)
Below progress bar show milestone chips:
7 days (Sprout)
30 days (Plant)
60 days (Strong plant)
90 days (Tree)
Each chip:
unlocked: glowing + check icon
locked: dim + small lock icon
Tap a milestone → opens a mini modal explaining:
“What changes users often report” (careful language: “may”, “often”)
“Recommended focus for this phase” (action advice)
7) Seed Garden “Atmosphere” section (makes it feel alive)
Add a small “atmosphere” strip:
“Today’s Growth”
“Streak: X”
“Urges resisted: Y”
“Focus: (from daily focus module if exists)”
This card uses subtle animation when values update.
8) Growth Timeline Screen (Scrollable, Emotional)
/timeline shows a vertical timeline:
Each milestone card contains:
Title (example):
Day 1 — “The Start”
Day 3 — “First Resistance”
Day 7 — “Momentum”
Day 14 — “Stability”
Day 30 — “Rewire Begins”
Day 60 — “Stronger Identity”
Day 90 — “New Default”
Short 1–2 line description
Locked/unlocked based on streak.current or totalCleanDays
Progress connector line between milestones
As you scroll, cards fade-in + slide-up animation
Unlocked milestones show:
a glow border + checkmark Locked milestones show:
dim + “X days left”
9) Rewards Hook (Optional but premium)
When user unlocks a milestone:
show a modal:
“Milestone unlocked”
award orbs (+5)
“Share this win” button (just UI)
10) Integration with Streak Updates
When a user completes a clean day:
update seed stage + progress
on next open of Garden:
run “growth animation”
show toast: “Your seed grew today 🌱”
Do NOT over-notify; keep it calm and premium.
11) Done Criteria
Garden screen renders and looks premium
Seed stage reflects streak correctly
Stage progress bar animates smoothly
Milestones lock/unlock correctly
Timeline screen scroll animations work
Data persists after app restart
No explicit content, store safe
Enhance the Seed Garden UI with a subtle star-particle background and parallax depth.
Add tiny, low-opacity star dots that move slower than the foreground when the user scrolls (parallax effect).
Particles must be very light (performance-safe) and only decorative.
Add a faint gradient glow behind the seed that reacts slightly to seed growth animations.
Keep motion calm, slow, and elegant—no fast or distracting effects.
Result:
The garden feels alive and deep, like space breathing quietly 🌌
✨ ADD-ON 2: HAPTICS + MICRO-FEEDBACK (MOBILE MAGIC)
Paste this next:
Add subtle haptic feedback for key moments in the Seed Garden (mobile only):
light haptic when progress bar increases
medium haptic when a milestone unlocks
gentle success haptic on stage upgrade
Also add micro-feedback animations:
progress bar glow pulse on growth
milestone card soft glow + scale-in on unlock
Keep all feedback restrained and premium (no vibration spam).
Result:
Users feel progress, not just see it ✨
🌿 OPTIONAL FINAL TOUCH (VERY ELITE)
If you want one last emotional layer, paste this:
Add a “Garden Reflection” card at the bottom of the Garden screen that updates daily with one calm line such as:
“Growth is invisible until it isn’t.”
“Consistency beats intensity.”
“Today mattered.”
Rotate from a fixed list.
Fade-in animation only once per day
