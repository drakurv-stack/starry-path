Build a premium Panic Button / Urge Rescue feature that is the core of this app.
It must be fast, calming, and feel high-end (space gradient + glass cards + glow + smooth animations).
No backend required—use localStorage only. Do NOT ask for Autonomous mode.
1) Access + Placement
Add a large glowing CTA on Home: “Panic Button” / “Take back control”
Route: /panic
Also show a small shortcut inside Coach: “Open Panic Button”
2) Panic Flow (4-stage guided rescue)
Use a stepper UI (progress dots) with smooth slide transitions:
Stage 1 — “Name it to tame it” (10 seconds)
Title: “Pause. You’re safe.”
Ask:
Urge level slider (0–10)
Trigger chips (multi-select): Stress, Boredom, Loneliness, Late night, Social media, Anxiety, Tired, Random
Primary button: “Start Rescue”
Secondary link: “Skip → start breathing”
Stage 2 — Breath Reset (60–90 seconds)
Glass card with breathing animation:
Inhale 4s → Hold 2s → Exhale 6s (loop)
Countdown timer + subtle pulse/glow
Text changes based on urge level:
0–3: “Small wave. Let it pass.”
4–7: “Strong wave. Breathe through the peak.”
8–10: “Peak urge. Stay with me for 60 seconds.”
Buttons:
“I’m calmer → continue”
“Still strong → extend 60 sec”
Stage 3 — “Delay & Replace” (10-minute plan)
Show 3 stacked premium glass cards:
Card A: 10-Min Delay Timer
Start / Pause / Reset
Shows “You’re rewiring your brain right now.”
Optional: “Lock screen mode” (just UI if not supported)
Card B: Choose 2 Quick Actions (tap to complete)
Actions list (checkbox style with micro animations):
Walk 2 minutes
Cold water / wash face
20 push-ups / 1 minute plank
Journal 3 lines
Clean desk for 3 minutes
Message someone (template: “Need a quick distraction”)
Require completing at least 2 actions OR finishing timer.
Card C: Thought Break (1-minute cognitive tool)
Prompt: “What do you actually need right now?”
Options (tap):
Rest
Connection
Achievement
Comfort
Relief
Based on selection, show one short suggestion.
Stage 4 — Success + Reward (premium “win” screen)
Trigger when:
breathing completed AND (2 actions done OR timer finished) Show:
✅ “Urge resisted”
“You just weakened the habit loop.”
Reward:
+1 orb
increment “Urges resisted”
CTA buttons:
“Back to Home”
“Log a quick check-in” (optional jump to /checkin)
3) Logging + Personalization (localStorage)
Create panic_v1 storage:
urgeEvents[]:
{id, dateISO, timeISO, urgeLevel, triggers[], completedBreathing, delaySeconds, actionsDone[], needSelected, outcome("resisted"|"partial"), notes?}
panicStats:
{urgesResisted, lastUrgeAtISO, bestDayCount, totalBreathingSessions}
Persist everything.
4) Integrate with streak + seed growth
If user completes a Panic session successfully:
+1 orb
increment urgesResisted
optional: give seed progress bonus (tiny)
Add Home mini cards:
“Urges resisted: X”
“Last rescue: Today / Yesterday”
“Best day: Y urges resisted”
5) Premium UI requirements
Background: dark starfield/space gradient
Glass cards with blur + glow outline
Gradient pill primary buttons
Progress dots/stepper
Animated breathing circle
Micro feedback when:
action completed
stage advances
success screen appears
Typography: big headline + short subcopy like your screenshots
6) Safety / compliance
No explicit content
Use neutral terms (“urges”, “habit”, “explicit content”)
Footer: “Support tool. Informational only, not medical advice.”
7) Done criteria
The Panic flow works end-to-end
Timers work reliably
Actions checklist works
Success triggers correctly
Logs persist after refresh
Home stats update correctly
UI looks premium and consistent
