# PPGbetter attribution and license

UrgeWatch includes a TypeScript port of the active pulse-estimation path in the PPGbetter Android app. It uses average frame luminance, three-frame local maxima, a minimum gap between accepted peaks, and the median of intervals from the latest 10 seconds. The Android source computes a smoothed value, but the active peak detector does not use it.
